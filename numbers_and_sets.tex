\section{Introduction}

Expect:
\begin{compactitem}
    \item precise definitions
    \item rigorous proofs
    \item foundational questions
\end{compactitem}

We start with assumptions called \emph{axioms}.

A \emph{statement} is a sentence that can have a true or false value.
A \emph{proof} is a sequence of true statements without logical gaps
establishing some conclusion.

\begin{compactitem}
\item show they are true
\item gain insight into why they are true
\item the proof might be cool
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Number Systems}

Define $\mathbb{N}$ as the set of natural numbers, $\{1,2,3,\cdots\}$ (note the lack of $0$).
Define $\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{R}$ to be 
integer, rational, and real sets respectively.

A real number is \emph{algebraic} if it is the
root of some polynomial with integer coefficients.
Non-algebraic numbers are called \emph{transcendental}.

The existence of a transcendental number was shown in 1844.

\subsection{Some Proofs and Nonproofs}

\begin{theorem}
    For all positive integers $n$, $n^{3} - n$ is always a multiple of $3$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $n^{3} - n = n(n^{2} - 1) = (n - 1) \times n \times (n+1)$.
    One of the three consecutive integers $n-1,n,n+1$ must be a multiple of $3$.
    Thus, the product $n^{3} - n$ must also be a multiple of $3$.
\end{proof}

Note the little box given for free by \LaTeX, on the right side of the page.
That denotes the end of the proof.

\begin{theorem}
    For any positive integer $n$, if $n^{2}$ is even then so is $n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{nonproof}
    Given $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we can write $n = 2k$ where $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
    We have $n^{2} = 4k^{2} = 2(2k^{2})$, which is even.
\end{nonproof}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose on the contrary that $n^{2}$ is even so $n = 2k+1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
    Then we have,
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
        n^{2} = (2k+1)^{2} &= 4k^{2} + 4k + 1 \\
                     &= 4(k^{2} + k) + 1.
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    which is odd, contradicting the assumption that $n^{2}$ is even.
    \contra
\end{proof}
